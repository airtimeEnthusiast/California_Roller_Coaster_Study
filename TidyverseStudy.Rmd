Intro:
Ever since I was tall enough to go on a thrilling roller coaster, they have been a relatively interesting hobby for many reasons besides the wonderful rush of adrenaline. Roller Coasters are great models of reality such as structural and mechanical engineering, programmable logic software, control theory and statistical analysis in this case. In this report I choose to focus on roller coasters within the state of California because it is currently the state with the most roller coasters about 93 as of this report with a few new coasters to open in 2022 as well as some that are in the process of being removed. Many coasters such as children coasters have very similar layouts, little information on stats, and lack interesting characteristics so they might not be emphasized much for this reason. However it is quite obvious that some things cannot be analyzed easily such as rider hourly capacity and inconsistency with ride duration. Some stats however were relatively easy to find such as height, speed, inversion count, manufacture, and manufacture model name/type. I have ridden over 90% of the coasters on this list more than once so I have a good idea of the ride experience.

# 2A. The Dipper Twins 
Roller Coasters grew ever so popular around the turn of the Century in the US. The two classic Giant Dippers are the two California Classics both Designed by the legendary Frank Prior and Fredrick Church. However many disappeared post 1929 until a renissance occured beginning in the 1950s

# 2A. The Disney Innovation and beginning of the "coaster wars"  
Inspired from his last film Third Man on the Mountain, Walt Disney had the ambition to build first tubular steel track roller coasters in the form of the Matterhorn Bobsleds. Manufactured by Arrow Development, this contractor would go on to design many early Disney dark ride systems and become a [dominante](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGKgVxx5Wu8) player in the roller coaster industry
